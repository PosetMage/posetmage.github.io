## What is PosetMage

What's a **Partially Ordered Set**?

Imagine you're organizing numbers. You know 1 is less than 3 (1 < 3), and 3 is less than 5 (3 < 5). That means 1 is also less than 5 (1 < 5)!  That's the core idea of a **Partially Ordered Set**.

A Partially Ordered Set is just a way to show how things are related, where some things "come before" others. Not *everything* needs to be directly compared – it's like a skill tree in a game. You need some skills before you can get others, but you might be able to choose between different paths.

What's **Partially Ordered Magic**?

To learn high-level magic, you need to learn low-level magic first. It's a Skill Tree!  The sequence of skills is based on a Partially Ordered Set.  So, Partially Ordered Magic *is* the Skill Tree!
